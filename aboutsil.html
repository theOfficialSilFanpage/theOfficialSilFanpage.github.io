    <h1>Sil (The Seed Pokémon)</h1>
    <h3>
        Sil is a vey sexy alien who mines rocks and stuff.<br><br>
        The seed pokémon sil is a grass, poison type with the abilities of overgrow and chlorophyll. 87.5% of sil are male with 45 catch rate. He is 2'04" and 15.2lbs.<br><br>
        As the representative of the Galatron Mining Corporation on the planet Varos, Sil lied about the value of Zeiton-7 to get the cheapest price for it. He was also interested in buying and distributing recordings of the various tortures which passed for entertainment on Varos. These schemes ended when the Sixth Doctor informed the Governor of Varos of the true value of the commodity. Sil hoped to secure rights to videos of the torture of criminals on Varos (already served up, on television as entertainment for Varos' oppressed citizens) and market them on other worlds. (TV: Vengeance on Varos)<br><br>
        Prior to 2379, Sil allied himself with the Ice Warriors to profit from their invasion of the planet Magnus, which he hoped to make have a colder climate to suit the Ice Warriors, while he also made a profit selling the natives warm clothes. (AUDIO: Mission to Magnus)<br><br>
        In 2379, on his homeworld of Thoros Beta, Sil became involved in weapons dealing with the primitive peoples of the planet Krontep. The Sixth Doctor, seemingly as a ruse, worked together with Sil, the Doctor using his knowledge of future history to determine the best investment prospects. (TV: Mindwarp)<br><br>
        In 2382, the Universal Monetary Fund sent Sil to London to try an recuperate some of the money they had lent Amadeus Boscoe's government. He suggested radical cuts to aid this recuperation and asked his master Lord Mav for a further loan. Boscoe allowed him to become part of his government. He used Anzor's TARDIS to lure the Sixth Doctor to London, where he asked Cordelia Crozier to experiment on him to find all immunities. He suggested releasing Cholera and the Bubonic plague to reduce the population of United Kingdom. He killed Crozier, because of the death of Kiv and led Cordelia to believe the Doctor did it.
