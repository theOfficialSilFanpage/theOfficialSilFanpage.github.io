    <h4 id="loveletter">Dear Sil.</h4>
    <p id="loveletter">Roses are red,<br>
        Violets are blue,<br>
        Fucking hell Sil,<br>
        I would bang you.<br><br>
    </p>
    <h4 id="loveletter">Shall I compare thee to a Varos day?</h4>
    <p id="loveletter">
        Shall I compare thee to a Varos day?<br>
        Thou art more sexy and more slimy.<br>
        Rough sex do shake the Sil bed of love,<br>
        And your leash hath all too short a whip.<br>
        Sometime too hot the sac of Sil shines,<br>
        And often is his green complexion brightened;<br>
        And every alien from far sometime prays,<br>
        By chance, or by Silâ€™s godly powers, untouched;<br>
        But thy eternal love shall not fade,<br>
        Nor lose possession of that fair Sil ass,<br>
        Nor shall death touch lord Sil in his nonosquare,<br>
        When in eternal love to Sil does grow.<br>
        So long as people can breathe, or eyes can see,<br>
        So long live Sil, and his godly life to me.<br><br>
    </p>
    <h4 id="loveletter">A Haiku.</h4>
    <p id="loveletter">
        The love remains<br>
        As if you are here<br>
        In my ass.<br><br>
    </p>
    <h4 id="silove">
        Sil is love, Sil is life.
